    "# Environments defined with Gymnasium\n",

    "\n",
    "`Gymnasium` (https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) is the most popular library for defining environment classes and provides a lot of helpful wrappers, as well as an unified and clearly defined interface that all environments follow. It is a fork (continuation) of OpenAI's `Gym`, note that the original `Gym` is no longer maintained by anyone. Sometimes, people refer to `Gym` when they mean `Gymnasium` as a shorthand, or in older posts/literature used `Gym` when it was the main library.\n",

    "The Monty Hall is a well-known problem that originated from a game show, it can be stated as follows:\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",

    "# Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "Some Reinforcement Learning algorithms have an abundance of parameters; especially in the territory of Deep Reinforcement Learning, where you could tune the batch size and even the neural network layout, amongst the learning rate and exploration rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important that we are able to systematically tune these hyperparameters in an automated fashion, as the number of combinations of parameters and interdependent effects are too numerous to manually tune (aside from setting a good starting point). Tuning is an art in and of itself, and is a form of optimization. Luckily, many libraries exist for finding the optimal set of hyperparameters, using various different approaches such as genetic algorithms, in order to explore and exploit areas of the tuning state space that are promising automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "Exactly how hyperparameter tuning chooses to select combinations of parameters, continue runs (also known as *sweeps*, each sweep having an unique combination of parameters) or stop early, is an art in and of itself. There are many methods and algorithms that are out of scope for this project, although it should be noted that we are not simply enumerating all possible parameters as in a grid search, for example instead we can choose to use a random search or Bayes search.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we define is a tunable parameter, such as the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        learning_rate   = dict(min=1e-5,  max=1e-2,  distribution=\"log_uniform_values\"),\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **What it is:** a rule for the hyperparameter tuning library, stating it should *try out different learning-rates* during a hyperparameter sweep.\n",
    "* **The range:** it may pick anything between **0.00001** and **0.01**.\n",
    "* **How the picks are made:** not evenly spaced, but **log-uniformly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Think “pick a random exponent” rather than “pick a random number.”\n",
    "  * Each order of magnitude (10⁻⁵ → 10⁻⁴ → 10⁻³ → 10⁻²) is equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why log-uniform?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With learning rates, what matters is usually the *order of magnitude*, not the exact decimal.\n",
    "2. A log-uniform draw therefore spends just as much effort exploring tiny values (which often work best) as it does larger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: *“Try lots of learning-rates between 0.000 01 and 0.01, giving every magnitude the same chance, because we don’t yet know which size step the optimiser will like.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just one tunable parameter, and the problem of hyperparameter tuning is you have to select values for multiple hyperparameters at the same time, where hyperparameters are not always independent of each other, and you have limited compute time to run these experiments in. This is why specialised algorithms exist just for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is hyperparameter tuning needed?\n",
    "Finding the best set of hyperparameters allows converging (achieving the optimal/best performance) in a quicker fashion. It is possible that a default set of hyperparameters could converge to an optimal policy, but take 1000 times longer than using a set of optimal hyperparameters. Sometimes, without optimal hyperparameters it can also be easy for the policy to appear it has converged but it has converged to a sub-optimal policy instead of the policy that produces the best reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weights and Biases\n",
    "Weights and Biases (referred to commonly as W&B or WandB) is a standard tool used in both industry and academia for tracking (and storing) the results of experiments. In other words, Weights and Biases is an end-to-end developer platform that keeps every experiment, dataset, model checkpoint, and evaluation in a single, searchable workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we use it both as a hyperparameter tuning library and storing the results of experiments based on these hyperparameters.\n",
