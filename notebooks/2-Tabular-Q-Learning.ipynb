    "## The \"Control\" Problem\n",
    "A **reinforcement‑learning agent** interacts with an **environment** in a repeated loop:\n",
    "1. **Observe & act**  \n",
    "   The agent observes its current state and chooses an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Environment transition**  \n",
    "   The environment then returns  \n",
    "   - the next state, drawn randomly from the transition probabilities conditioned on the current state and action, and\n",
    "   - a numerical reward value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat**  \n",
    "   Control returns to Step 1 and the cycle continues until the episode terminates, either because an end-state (terminal state) is reached or because a predefined time step limit is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an example *environment* where a robot is learning to solve a maze. The environment could either be:\n",
    "* **Simulated** – defined entirely by software. Modern simulators can step extremely fast, allowing you to run millions of time‑steps per second on a GPU cluster.  \n",
    "* **Real‑world** — the physical maze itself with a robot that is able to detect its state, select an action, and receive a reward. Here the interaction rate is limited by actuator and sensor latency, often on the order of one action per second. To collect experience faster you would need to run multiple robots in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the simulated environment is faster to train on, you would likely want to train the robot on the simulated environment that replicates the real-world environment, and later deploy the robot in the real-world rather than training there. However, perfect replication remains a challenge, and this is called the \"sim-to-real\" challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases the formal control loop above remains the same: observe, act, receive the next state and reward, repeat. You can optionally read the following subsection for learning more theoretical background on modelling the agent-environment interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Background) Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "We can formally model the agent-environment interaction contract as a **Markov Decision Process** (MDP). This modelling helps us rigorously and clearly define the problem and our assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *Markov Decision Process* $\\mathcal{M}$ is described by the elements in the following tuple: $$\\mathcal M = \\langle \\mathcal S,\\;\\mathcal A,\\;P,\\;R,\\;\\gamma\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **States** where each state $s \\in \\mathcal{A}$ captures the active facts of the system.\n",
    "* **Actions** in each state $s$ ($s \\in \\mathcal{S}$), an agent can take an action $a (a \\in \\mathcal{A}$), which results in a new state $s'$ that is the result of taking the action. Actions can either be deterministic (always ending up in the same resulting state) or probabilistic (ending up in a certain state from a set of states due to stochastic/random/uncertain elements).\n",
    "* $P(s' \\mid s,a)$ is the transition probability from a starting state $s$, taking a particular action $a$, to the next state $s'$.\n",
    "* $R(s,a,s') = \\mathbb E\\![\\,r_{t+1}\\mid s_t=s,\\,a_t=a,\\,s_{t+1}=s'\\,]$ is the expected one-step reward. One-step is defined by the agent starting in state $s$, takes an action $a$, and ends up in the resultant state $s'$.\n",
    "* $\\gamma\\in[0,1]$ discounts future rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The return can be defined as $G_t$, as below:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_t \\;=\\; r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+3} + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above definitions are quite straightforward, however, you may be wondering what the purpose of a discount factor exactly is. A low discount factor (e.g 0.1) essentially states that getting a smaller reward earlier is better than a large reward much later down the line. In non-episodic RL settings, since the reward horizon may be infinite, you lose convergence guarantees without setting a discount factor. Whereas in episodic RL settings, while you can use a discount factor of 1.0, a slightly smaller $\\gamma$ (e.g. 0.99) damps far-future noise, helping reduce variance."

    "## Finding an Optimal Policy\n",
    "Recall that a policy is the rulebook that tells the agent which action to take in any particular state. A policy can be *deterministic* (one state maps to one action) or *stochastic* (one state maps to a probability distribution of actions to take). For now, we will assume a deterministic policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find an **optimal policy**, which we call $\\pi^*$, that maximises the expected return from every state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning with Model-Based and Model-Free algorithms\n",
    "There are two key kinds of Reinforcement Learning algorithms we can consider, one is **model-based** algorithms, and the other is **model-free** algorithms. **Model-based** algorithms assume having access to a function which predicts state transitions ($* $P(s' \\mid s,a)$) and rewards ($R(s,a,s')$), which we call a model. Analogously, model-free algorithms do not assume access to such a predicting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a model, you can perform planning (i.e. \"thinking\" multiple time steps ahead before performing actions), which in turn increases the sample efficiency of learning (meaning that you do not have to perform as much training). This model can also be learnt from interacting with the environment, with the challenge of learning an accurate representation, particularly with unseen data. However, the real environment dynamics are usually not accessible to the agent or can be costly to compute (e.g. involves calling an external solver). Additionally, vanilla planning techniques are not as suited towards large combinatorial action and state spaces. As model-free algorithms involve a weaker assumption, and thus is more general to learn, we will start with a model-free algorithm known as *Tabular Q-Learning*."

    "## Tabular Q-Learning\n",
    "Recall that we want to train our reinforcement‑learning (RL) agent so that it maximises the *cumulative (discounted) return* — the total reward it collects over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to achieve this is to learn an action‑value function $Q(s, a)$. From experience, we estimate how advantageous it is to take action $a$ in state $s$ and then follow the current policy thereafter.\n",

    "When the state and action spaces are discrete and not too large, $Q$ can be stored explicitly as a table, with one scalar entry for each $(s, a)$ pair. In larger problems, we would have to approximate $Q$ with a parameterised function (e.g. a neural network).\n",
    "\n",
    "**That is all Tabular Q‑Learning is: training a table that tells you how valuable every possible state–action pair is.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bellman Recursive Relationship\n",
    "The **optimal** action‑value function $Q^*$ satisfies the Bellman optimality equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $Q^*$ on the right‑hand side is *the very function we are trying to learn*, the update **bootstraps** off its **own, imperfect estimate** of the next state. In practice we do **not** know the expectation over future states and rewards; we only ever see **single samples** $(s,a,r,s')$. Each update therefore uses\n",

    "\n",
    "Any error in the estimate of the next state propagates backwards through the recursion, which can make learning unstable if the learning‑rate $\\alpha$ is too high or the policy does not visit states often enough. Nevertheless, the recursion is also what allows Q‑learning to back‑up information from sparse rewards **without enumerating the entire state space**.\n",

    "### Exploration ↔ Exploitation\n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning, there is a classical dilemma know as the exploration-exploitation trade-off. At each step, the agent must choose between:\n",
    "* **exploitation** — taking the action it currently *believes* has the highest value so as to harvest reward now, and\n",

    "* with probability **$\\varepsilon$** pick a random action (**explore**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical training schedules start with $\\varepsilon\\approx0.1\\text{–}1.0$ to encourage wide exploration and **decay \\$\\varepsilon\\$ slowly** toward 0 as the table becomes more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated alternatives (e.g. Boltzmann exploration or Upper‑Confidence‑Bound methods) adapt the amount of exploration per state, but $\\varepsilon$‑greedy is often sufficient for tabular problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action masking\n",
    "When sampling actions, a policy ordinarily considers the full discrete action space $\\mathcal A$, regardless of the current state $s$. In many tasks only a subset $A(s)\\subseteq \\mathcal A$ is actually legal in state $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a 1‑D bin‑packing environment where items arrive sequentially and must be placed into one of $k$ fixed‑capacity bins. By having a mask, you can prevent the agent from performing an illegal action, that is placing an item in an already filled bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Background) On-policy vs Off-policy\n",

    "In this notebook, we covered the Reinforcement Learning control problem, with all of the nuances involved, and how to solve it using the most well-known and foundational approach, Tabular Q learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented two key functions for Tabular Q Learning, that is, how the exploration-exploitation using $\\varepsilon$ -greedy and how the Q-value table is updated after each time step, demonstrating your understanding of all of the details listed above. In future notebooks, we will import a provided reference implementation of Tabular Q Learning, which uses the same logic as here but has all the required helper/training-loop functions. You can view this reference implementation in more detail at `src/rl/tabular_q_learning.py` of the repository, but the important concepts have already been implemented in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions to the exercises are also available at `notebooks/solutions/tabular_q_learning.py` in case you are stuck in some implementation detail or perhaps you would simply like to compare your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will explore how to train and visualise your algorithm in detail, including using hyperparameter tuning rather than trying to guess the optimal learning rate and epsilon yourself!"
